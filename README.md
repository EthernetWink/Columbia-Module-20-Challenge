# Columbia-Module-20-Challenge

This solidity code provides the framework for a smart contradt that includes two addresses. 

If an address that is not one of the two addresses specified at the beginning, no trasnactions are made. If they are, the trasnactions can be made and the two addresses have a joint contract.
